[Transcript](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mrexodia/year-progress-gemini/blob/master/session.html) (sorry if there is swearing in there). Likely pi is not the right harness for Gemini, because this looks worse than some of the output from things like GPT OSS 20b. The model consistently fails to accomplish anything, even with human debugging and errors logs. Similar minor UI/UX issues were often fixed right away by Opus/GLM.
